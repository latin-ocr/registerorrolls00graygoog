lections of recorda ever existed, it is scarcely possible that there
should be 00 complete an absence 01 111010 01 1110 present time,
secing that we possess so many monastic charter-books 01 an
earlier date, although the great religions societies have expc-
rienced more rough shocks than episcopacy. The official regis-
11011οο 01 0010000οΙ documents was probably regarded as snper-
fluous. The simple productiori 010 grant, under scal and duly
witnessed, would be considered a sufficient warrant for the
tenure 01 0 living or an estate. As thc number 01 00011 granta
increased, the keeping 01 00 official note-book, such as Arch-
bishop Gray’s Register is, made the retention 01 000100 and

The Register 01 Α101111101100 Gray consists of two rolls, called
the major and 11101101, but this designationis not ofan early ·
date. It was suggested by the 'length of the respective docu-
ments. They are written on both sides, and when put together
make one grand chart 70 1001 long by 8} inches in width.
There was, probably, a third roll at one time, aethe acts 01 1110

we must look upon this register or roll, when it was perfect, as
one document, divided 101 convenience and readiness 01 uae
into three parts. The first 01 111000, as I said before, is missing.

appended to the same roll. The beginning 01 11110 part is torn
