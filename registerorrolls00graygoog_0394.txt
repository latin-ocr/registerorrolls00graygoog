THE SURTEES SOOIETY,

REPORT FOR ΤΗΕ ΥΕΑΒ truecouxlx.

A rulers-lurra anniversary might reasonably be supposed to
suggest to any Soeiety some ideas of old age and deeay, but the
Sortees society, although it is the oldest 01 the publishing clubs
01 the day, has lost little, if any, 01 the strength and energy of
its youth. Of the gentlemen who became members in 1834,
there are ten still sorviviug, and it must be a gratification 10
1110111 10 look upon the continued success 01 011 association with
which they have been connected so long.

The past year has not been au eventful one. There is one
occurrence, however, which the (louncil most sineerely deplere,
and that is the decease of a brother Councillor of no ordinary
merit and repnte, Mr. J. R. Walbrau, of Ripon. Mr. Walbran
is well known to the members and the ublic by his volume on
F ountains Abbey, into which he threw himself with an enthu-
siasm and a determination whioh few modern antiquaries have
evinoed. At the time of his premature and lamented death,
Mr. Walbran was busily engaged upon a second volume 01 the
same work, and itis to be feared that to his devotion to literary
pursuits the cutting short of his valuable life is 10 be ascribed.

Another volume 01 Wills and Inventories selected from the
testamentary treasures in the registry at York will soon be in the
hands 01 the members. Although it is the fourth 01 a series, the

reseut volume will not descend below the reign 01 Henry VII.

01010 so much of interest during that early period, that it
would be an injustice to the subject if it were to be needlessly
curtailed. From no documenta cau we derive 0 0100101 insight
into the lives and manners 01 001 0110001010 than from their wille,
end the volumes which the Surtees Society has produced 010
among the most useful and popular of its publicatione
