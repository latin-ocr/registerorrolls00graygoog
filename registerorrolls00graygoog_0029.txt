XX usuratu.

The archbishop was a part in a system, an agent amid
many agencies, the mouth-piace of the collective wisdom of the

, heads of his province and his chapter, notan irresponsible
oracle. He was bound, in the first place, to carry out the de·
crees of the Councils of the Church, and as to the interpretation
of doubtful points, and for special guidance and instruction in
questions of novelty and difficulty, he was in frequent com·

munication with the papal court. The two chief Cormcils‚ the
decrees of which may especially be traccd on the acts of Arch-
bishop Gmy, arc those held at the Lateran in 1179 and 1215,
at which the great practioal questions of non-resideam, plural-
ity, lapses, and thc endowment and consolidation of livings, were
particularly treated. Founded upon these and other similar
utterances of the Charch, he, no doubt, laid down, with the
assent and advice of his council, certain decrees of his own. A
few only of these remain, relating to the authorised ornaments
of churches, and a prescribed system of tithing 3* but these are
remnants, probably, ofa larger code, which I have been unable
to discover. There is nothing to show whether they were of
aprovincial or merely diocesan character. If they were dio-
cesan, like those of several of the early bishops of Dmham, they
would have the approval of the diocesan synod before they were
issued in the archbishop's name3 on the other hand, if they were
designcd for the Northem province, they would be enacted after
duc consideration with the bishops and clergy of the province
in Convocation assemblcd. On matters of a more serious im-
port‚ in which the interests of the whole English Church were
concerned, the N orthern and the Seuthem Convocations met in
joint assembly, or, at all events, there was a conference between
the two. A letter written to Ilenry III. in 1252, from the
chief persons in the Northem Convocation, testifies to the pre·
valence of such maetings in times of emergency.† On great
occasions, such as the Council at London in 1237, when the le-
