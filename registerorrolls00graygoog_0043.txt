contained in the college of that name* In making this dona·
tion he had before him the example of one of his own friends,
William of Laneham, Archdeacon of Durham and Canon of
York. This brings the archbishop into close connection with
the true founder of University College, und therefore of the
l'uiversity. of Oxford, on which the gratuitous assumption of a
remote antiquity confers nothing but the ridicule of scholare.
Laneham was, no doubt, anative of the village of that name in
Nottinghamshire, where the Archbishop of York had a favonrite
residence aud immense influence. If the secret were known,
we should probably find that Archbishop Gray was the helper
and adviser of William of Laneham, or William of Durham, as
he is called, not only in his benefaction to Oxford, but also in
his foundation of the college of Vicars Choral in connection with
the Minster of York.

'l’he publication of this Register throws 'some little light

upon the architectural works of Arohbishop Gray, so conspi-
’ cuous as they'are even at tbe present time for their dignity and

beauty. 'lbere are indulgences for the fabric of each of the four
minsters of his diocese, in all of which there is work remaining
which carries us back to the days of the great archbishop. The
foundation deed of the chantry of St. Michael, in the south tran-
sept of the nave at York, gives us, practically, the date of its
completiont 'l’he western frontet Ripon, the famous transept
at York, the lovely little church of Skelton near the same city,
the chapol of the ancient palace there, now used as the library
of the minster, remind us of Gray’s taste and munificence, and
attest the excellency of the Early English style of architectura,
of which they are such noble monuments. 1 could multiply
instances, but these shall spealr for others as they speak for
themselves. '
There are many documento made use ofin the illustration of
this work, which are interesting iu the highest degree; the ex·
