which the chapter stood to the archbishop as his advisere.
When the archbishop was the head 01 the chapter, in the same
sense in which the dean is now, beliad but one vote in 111 consul-
tatione, and his decision was the decision 01 the majority, just as·
it was in the case 01 the pope and the Sacred College in the early
annale 01 the Cburch of Rome. But this custom did not pre-
vail at York subseqnent to 1111 Conquest. In the time 01
Archbishop Gray, the chapter aa a consultative body was
independent 01 the archbishop, but it still assisted him in
his diocesan work. There is extant a very important letter
from Honorius 111, 11 which, at Gray's request, 111 allows the
dean, precentor, chancellor, and treasurer of York to be
occasionally non-resident, to assist the primate with their
advice* They needed such a permission, inasmuch as they
were required by their duty to the Minster to be in almost
continual residence. The other canons might come and go to
the archbishop without let or enquiry. From the list 01 wit·
nesses appended 10 the official acts 01 Walter Gray, it is evident
that he had generally with him not only several representatives
of the chapter 01 Υο111, but at least one from each 01 those 01
sipon, Beverley, and Southwell. These seemed to have formed
a kind 01 travelling council to which 111 could at all times refer.
They were a kind 01 committee representing their chapters
at home. In the first instance they had, Ι believe, a voice in

everything that the archbishop did, even 10 the giving away 01

livings. In Gray’s time this, 10 doubt, was considerahly
modified, yet still the recommendation 01 the council was to be
taken. This conjunction, however, did not continue long, and
I believe that the breaking up 01 this system was caused not
more hythe desire 01 the chapters 10 be more independent 01
the archbishops‚ than 01 the archbishops to be free 110111 the
say 01 the committes 01 the chapters.

The chapter 01 York, then, during Archbishop ijs primacy,
was exempt from, and yet assistant in, diocesan work. The
archdeacons were not etc-officio members 01 11 at all. The rural-
